    <h1>About my Friend</h1>
    <strong>Sumanth</strong> and I met during our MCA program, and we quickly became friends. We ended up as roommates
    in a PG, which turned out to be a lot of fun. Sumanth was always up for a game of BGMI, and almost every night, he’d
    fire it up, calling me over to join. Even if we had a long day with assignments and projects, he’d convince me to
    play "just one game"—which, of course, always turned into a few more.
